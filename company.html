              <img src="images/building.jpg" align="right" border="1" />SAIL
              manufactures and sells a broad range of steel products, including
              hot and cold rolled sheets and coils, galvanised sheets,
              electrical sheets, structurals, railway products, plates, bars and
              rods, stainless steel and other alloy steels. SAIL produces iron
              and steel at five integrated plants and three special steel
              plants, located principally in the eastern and central regions of
              India and situated close to domestic sources of raw materials,
              including the Company's iron ore, limestone and dolomite mines.
              The company has the distinction of being India’s second largest
              producer of iron ore and of having the country’s second largest
              mines network. This gives SAIL a competitive edge in terms of
              captive availability of iron ore, limestone, and dolomite which
              are inputs for steel making.
            </p>

              SAIL's wide range of long and flat steel products are much in
              demand in the domestic as well as the international market. This
              vital responsibility is carried out by SAIL's own Central
              Marketing Organisation (CMO) that transacts business through its
              network of 37 Branch Sales Offices spread across the four regions,
              25 Departmental Warehouses, 42 Consignment Agents and 27 Customer
              Contact Offices. CMO’s domestic marketing effort is supplemented
              by its ever widening network of rural dealers who meet the demands
              of the smallest customers in the remotest corners of the country.
              With the total number of dealers over 2000 , SAIL's wide marketing
              spread ensures availability of quality steel in virtually all the
              districts of the country.
