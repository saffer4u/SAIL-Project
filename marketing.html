            <p>
              700 million Indians live in rural India.
              <br />
              India can truly move forward only when all Indians get every
              opportunity to make their lives better – including building better
              homes.
              <br />
              It has been SAIL’s endeavor to make quality steel available to
              every consumer in his vicinity. This is more than an effort, it is
              a mission born out of a firm conviction that none in India shall
              be resigned to live in tacky dwellings for want of quality steel.
              <br />
              Even as SAIL triumphantly declares its contribution to
              <a href="pdf/SAIL in nation building.pdf"
                ><font color="#blue">projects of national importance</font></a
              >, it works towards empowering the smallest steel consumer in the
              remotest corner of the country to enable him to build
              long-lasting, cost-effective and safe structures – homes, schools,
              hospitals, bridges, buildings etc.
              <br />
              SAIL has a country wide network of dealers; over 2000…and still
              growing!. This band of dealers ensures availability of quality
              steel in virtually all the districts of the country. There is a
              SAIL Dealer not far from where you are.
              <br />
              So take the first step towards your dream house. Step in to Apna
              SAIL Shop and walk out with your requirement of SAIL TMT (quality
              steel rebars for construction), SAIL JYOTI (India’s best
              galvanized plain – GP - and corrugated – GC- sheets and Light
              Structural.
              <br />
              Go ahead. Buy the best steel at the best price.
              <br />
              Come to Apna SAIL Shop. Do not hesitate even if your requirement
              of steel is small – may be just a couple of SAIL TMT rebars to
              surround you with security, or a sheet or two of SAIL JYOTI to
              cover your dwelling. No requirement is small…..because we
              understand your need. And, fulfill it.
